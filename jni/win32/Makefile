# On Win32, the following command builds a dynamic link library hello.dll using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0: 
#
#    cl -Ic:\java\include -Ic:\java\include\win32
#                    -LD HelloWorldImp.c -Fehello.dll

# On Linux libutil contains forkpty()

#
# This will most likely not be easily portable to Win32, except probably
# using cygwin. Do not expect it to work.
